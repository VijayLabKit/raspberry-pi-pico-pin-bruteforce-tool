## üìå Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build a **PIN brute-force testing tool** using a **Raspberry Pi Pico**.  
It leverages the Pico‚Äôs **USB HID capabilities** to simulate keystrokes, display feedback on an **OLED screen**, and intelligently handle lockouts using a **photoresistor-based detection system**.

## üìú Installation & Setup

1. **Flash CircuitPython**  
   - Download the latest **CircuitPython UF2** for Raspberry Pi Pico.
   - Drag & drop onto the Pico‚Äôs drive.

2. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Copy these to the Pico's `lib` folder:  
   - `adafruit_hid`
   - `adafruit_ssd1306`

3. **Upload the Code**  
   - Save `bruteforce.py` to the Pico.
   - Rename it to `code.py` if you want it to **auto-run** on boot.

4. **Connect to Target Device**  
   - Plug the Pico into your test device.
   - It will simulate keystrokes automatically.

## üß© Usage

- On startup, the OLED shows the **current PIN** and **attempt count**.
- The Pico automatically enters PINs via USB HID.
- If the LDR detects a **lockout**, attempts **pause** automatically.
- After the lockout delay, brute-forcing resumes automatically.
